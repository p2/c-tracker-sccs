<h1>How the Study Works</h1>
<p>Should you decide to participate, we will ask you to install our study app on your iPhone, get enrolled with the help of our study coordinator and complete your first survey.</p>
<p>From now on you will get a <strong>monthly</strong> reminder to complete a survey via the app for the <strong>next 12 months</strong>.
You will be able to complete the surveys in the app, meaning you are free to do so at your leisure, there is <em>no need to visit the clinic</em> again.
These surveys will take <strong>approximately 10 minutes</strong> of your time.
Apart of that you are free to use the other features of the app as you please.</p>
